## What is Libdogecoin?

Libdogecoin will be a complete implementation of the Dogecoin Protocols, as a C library (and series of bindings to popular languages) which will allow anyone to build a Dogecoin compliant product, without needing to worry about the deeper, complicated specifics of the crypto functions. 

Libdogecoin is here to make crypto development **simple**, **clean**, and **fun**!

This will be a pure library, providing a set of callable functions to implement in external projects, but not a ‘runnable’ node facility. Although we expect building a Dogecoin Node will be a useful test and early outcome, that will live in another repository.

It is intended that connecting the bits together into an engine be done at the level above, via the networking libraries of the host language.

### Advantages of Libdogecoin

* No dependencies in case no p2p network client is required (only dependency is [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) added as git subtree)
* The only dependency for the p2p network client is [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent) (very portable)
* optimized for MCU and low mem environments
* ~full test coverage
* mem leak free (valgrind check during CI)

### Current features
* Generating and storing private and public keys
* ECDSA secp256k1 signing and verification (through [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) included as git subtree)
* Generate recoverable signatures (and recover pubkey from signatures)
* BIP32 hierarchical deterministic key derivation
* Transaction generation, manipulation, signing and ser-/deserialization including P2PKH, P2SH, multisig
* Address generation
* Base58check encoding
* Native implementation of SHA256, SHA512, SHA512_HMAC, RIPEMD-160 including NIST testvectors
* Native constant time AES (+256CBC) cipher implementation including NIST testvectors
* Event based dogecoin P2P client capable of connecting to multiple nodes in a single thread (requires [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent))

## Why C? 

The Dogecoin Core project is written in C++, why move to C? This is a good question. 

The Dogecoin Core project was inherited when Dogecoin was originally forked and makes use of some reasonable heavy C++ libraries that add complexity to the build process, as well as cognitive complexity for new developers. 

The desire is to provide a simple to learn library with few external dependencies that can be built with relatively little setup by new developers.  Furthermore the aim of providing wrappers for a number of higher-level languages leans strongly toward either C or RUST from a binding/support perspective, and we believe C still has significantly more support when writing bindings for a wide variety of other languages.

## Dogecoin Standard/Spec

During the process of extracting the fundamentals from the Dogecoin Core Wallet (reference implementation) we aim to document ‘how Dogecoin works’ as a suite of tests and documents we are calling the Dogecoin Standard. 

See `/doc/spec`

By doing this we will be able to verify that the Libdogecoin implementation of Dogecoin’s internals is accurate to the OG wallet, and thus provide a mechanism for any future Dogecoin implementations to verify compliance with the Dogecoin Network.

## Contributing

***TL;DR***: Initially during the early phase of development we'll keep this simple, after the library starts to become a dependency for real projects this will likely change.

* Express interest and get added to the libdogecoin team on GitHub 
  and join the conversation in the Foundation discord server.
* Branch/PRs in this repository (see above point for access)
* Rebasing not merging
* Ensure tests
* Document how Dogecoin works as each feature is developed in [`/doc/spec`](doc/spec)
* 1 approval from another contributor required to merge to main
* Don't introduce dependencies without discussion (MIT)
* Collaborate before you innovate! 
* Have fun <3

## Repository Navigation

Advice on how to navigate this repository:
- [`/.libs/`](.libs) where the static library lives after it has been fully built.
- [`/contrib/<proj>`](contrib) a place for misc non-core experiments, utils, demo-nodes etc.
- [`/doc/*.md`](doc) general library documentation, see details below.
- [`/doc/spec/*.md`](doc/spec) a place to begin documenting the Dogecoin Standard as we go.
- [`/include/dogecoin/*.h`](include/dogecoin) provides header files for libdogecoin users, look here for .h.
- [`/src/<feature>/*.c,*.h`](src) look here for local .c/.h source implementing the contracts in `/include`.
- [`/wrappers/<lang>/`](wrappers) individual language bindings.
- [`/test/`](test) test suite.
- [`/`](.) Makefile, license, etc..

The `/doc` folder has many helpful resources regarding setup and usage of Libdogecoin, along with some educational content on the specifics of Dogecoin protocols. Their contents are listed below:
- [`address.md`](doc/address.md) Full description of dogecoin addresses and the Libdogecoin Essential Address API.
- [`bindings.md`](doc/bindings.md) Installation and setup guide for using the provided wrappers in Python and Golang.
- [`getting_started.md`](doc/getting_started.md) Detailed instructions for building, installing, and implementing the library in your project.
- [`project_roadmap.md`](doc/project_roadmap.md) Our plan for the future of Libdogecoin (with pictures!).
- [`tools.md`](doc/tools.md) Guidance on how to use provided helper scripts and tools like `such` and `sendtx`.
- [`transaction.md`](doc/transaction.md) Full description of dogecoin transactions and the Libdogecoin Essential Transaction API.

## Quick Start 
For more detailed build and installation instructions, please refer to [`getting_started.md`](docs/../doc/getting_started.md)

### Preliminary
Before attempting to build, make sure all the necessary dependencies for your architecture are installed.

_Debian/Ubuntu_
```
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool build-essential libevent-dev
```

_MacOS_
```
xcode_select --install
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
```

_Other_ - Please submit a pull request to add dependencies for your system, or update these.

### Building

_Debian / Ubuntu_

To build the full library, including the `such` and `sendtx` CLI tools, run the following autoconf commands:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

To build the pure library without net support, add the following flags to the `./configure` command:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-net --disable-tools
make
```
### Integration

Using Libdogecoin in your own project is very simple! Once the library is built, you will see the resulting `libdogecoin.a` file in the `/.libs` folder. Additionally, you will want to locate the `libdogecoin.h` header file in the `/include/dogecoin` folder. Move both of these files into your project directory, or somewhere where the compiler can find them. In your source code which uses the Libdogecoin API, make sure to include this `libdogecoin.h` header at the top of your code.

_main.c:_
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "libdogecoin.h"

int main() {
    // your code here...
}
```

Once you are ready to compile, the `libdogecoin.a` file must be linked to your source code, along with `libevent`. The resulting compilation command will looks similar to this:
```
gcc main.c -ldogecoin -levent -o myprojectname
```
