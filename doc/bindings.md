# Using Libdogecoin Bindings

## Introduction
The Libdogecoin repo contains not only the source code for a clean C library, but also includes a set of wrappers for all the high-level functions of Libdogecoin. These specific functions are defined in address.c and transaction.c, and enable the user to perform the following operations:
- Generate different types of valid public/private keypairs
- Verify that a given keypair or address is valid for the Dogecoin network
- Build a transaction from scratch by adding inputs and outputs
- Sign a raw transaction using a private key
- Manage the set of working transactions within a user session

You can implement these functions in your own projects by following the directions below to import the Libdogecoin bindings packages. Much wow!

## Python Wrappers
The Python Libdogecoin module uses Cython to build wrappers for the functions mentioned above. Cython creates a shared library which can be normally imported like any other Python package, so long as it resides on the PYTHONPATH variable which accessible through Python's `sys` module. You can achieve this either by specifying the export location of the shared library at build time, or by appending the relative location to your PYTHONPATH using `sys.path.append()` within your project. 

### Building and Testing
Building the shared library is simple! Firstly, make sure the Libdogecoin C library is built and functional for your architecture (confirm by running `make check`). Then run the following command from the root Libdogecoin folder, which exports the library to the tests folder:
```
python3 wrappers/python/libdogecoin/setup.py build_depends --host=<host_architecture> build_ext --build-lib wrappers/python/tests
```
The --host flag requires you to provide the name of the host architecture used while building the C library. Valid options are listed below, with default x86_64-pc-linux-gnu selected if no architecture is specified:
- arm-linux-gnueabihf
- aarch64-linux-gnu
- x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (default)
- x86_64-apple-darwin15
- x86_64-w64-mingw32
- i686-w64-mingw32
- i686-pc-linux-gnu

Congrats, you've just built the Python wrapper package! Test that they are functional by running unit tests for address and transaction functions:
```
python3 wrappers/python/tests/address_test.py
python3 wrappers/python/tests/transaction_test.py
```
If the wrappers are passing all the unit tests and you'd like to become a little more familiar with address functions, you can run the interactive address CLI program. Keep in mind this requires the shared library file to be in the pytest folder as well.
```
python3 wrappers/python/tests/address_cli.py
```
From the CLI you can generate different types of keypairs to see what they look like, as well as verify existing keypairs or addresses. You may enter the command `q` to exit the program. If you want to repeat the previous command but with different arguments you can use the `w` command in place of typing out its full name. For example, if you would like to generate one keypair for mainnet and another for testnet, here's what that would look like:

_Example:_
```
=====================================================================================
Press [q] to quit CLI
Press [w] to repeat previous command

Available commands:

        gen_keypair <which_chain | 0:main, 1:test>
        gen_hdkeypair <which_chain | 0:main, 1:test>
        derive_hdpubkey <master_privkey_wif>
        verify_keypair <privkey_wif> <p2pkh address> <which_chain | 0:main, 1:test>
        verify_hdkeypair <privkey_wif_master> <p2pkh address_master> <which_chain | 0:main, 1:test>
        verify_address <p2pkh address>


$ gen_keypair 0
WIF-encoded private key: QWMRfPdpXFwDZgiM3SxGGiV84PkXAz5YcadHx1m5YQudPsZQ8xQi
P2PKH address: DAyHW3EKctXVA9Xiiu6KAnS9Sowfs6BHEf

$ w 1
WIF-encoded private key: cmFoycxSTprQeZcyWcv1zENjXUYnefGuaLWPret6jJYEYuTUhtMj
P2PKH address: np3j4qxP5qFrTJwi86GStq1a7tdLFKghYq

$ q
```


### Integration
Once you've confirmed that the wrappers pass unit tests, you can move the shared library to your project directory, or run the above build command again specifying your project directory after the `--build-lib` flag. Now try calling some Libdogecoin functions from your project!

_Example:_
```py
import libdogecoin.libdogecoin as l

if __name__ == "__main__":
    l.context_start()

    my_keypair = l.generate_priv_pub_key_pair()
    print(f"My wif-encoded private key is {my_keypair[0]}.")
    print(f"My public p2pkh address is {my_keypair[1]}.")
    
    # your code here

    l.context_stop()
```
Keep in mind that any time a function related to a private key is called, it must be from within a secp256k1 context. Only one context should be started per session using `l.context_start()`, and should be stopped when the session is done using `l.context_stop()`. If a function is called outside of a secp256k1 context, you will receive an error resembling the following:
```
python3: src/ecc.c:73: dogecoin_ecc_verify_privatekey: Assertion `secp256k1_ctx' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

For more information and documentation on how to properly call all the functions of Libdogecoin from Python, see [address.md](address.md) and [transaction.md](transaction.md).

### Modifying Python Wrappers
If you are interested in making your own modifications to these wrappers, you can edit the `wrappers/python/libdogecoin/libdogecoin.pyx` file. Once your changes have been made, make sure to delete both the previous shared library file _and_ the Cython-generated `libdogecoin.c` file adjacent to `libdogecoin.pyx` prior to running the build command. Or, you can even run the bash script `wrappers/python/pytest/cython_tests.sh` to do this automatically and test out your implementation across all architectures.

### Downloading from PyPI
#TODO


## Golang Wrappers
The Go Libdogecoin module uses cgo to build wrappers call the functions in the C library, and this module can be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/jaxlotl/go-libdogecoin. Unlike Python, this module does not require building and can be used directly out of the box; **however, the library module for Go currently only supports Linux 64-bit architecture.**

### Integration
To use these wrappers inside of your own project, you must first include the correct import statement in your source code:
```go
package main

import "github.com/jaxlotl/go-libdogecoin"
```
If a module has not yet been created for your project, create it with `go mod init myproject`. From there, the following commands will make sure you are up to date with the most recent MINOR.PATCH:
```
go get -u github.com/jaxlotl/go-libdogecoin
go mod tidy
```
The output, if any, should tell you which version of go-libdogecoin you have downloaded. Now you are ready to call the functions from inside your project!

In order to access the functions inside this module, you must invoke the function through the `libdogecoin` package. All wrapped functions are named the same as those mentioned in the [Essential API description](transaction.md#essential-api), but with a preceding _capital_ "W" and underscore. For example, to call `start_transaction()` and `clear_transaction()` in your project, it would look like this:

_Example:_
```go
package main

import "github.com/jaxlotl/go-libdogecoin"

func main() {
    index := libdogecoin.W_start_transaction()
    defer libdogecoin.W_clear_transaction(index)
    /*
    your code here...
    */
}
```

Similar to Python, any time a function related to a private key is called, it must be from within a secp256k1 context. Start the context with `libdogecoin.W_context_start()` and stop the context with `libdogecoin.W_context_stop()`. If a function is called outside of a secp256k1 context, you will receive an error resembling the following:
```
myfilename: src/ecc.c:74: dogecoin_ecc_verify_privatekey: Assertion `secp256k1_ctx' failed.
SIGABRT: abort
PC=0x7fa9b3bb500b m=0 sigcode=18446744073709551610
signal arrived during cgo execution
```
